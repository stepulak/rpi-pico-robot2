# rpi-pico-robot2

Micropython source code for my homemade DIY 2WD tricycle robot.

The robot consist of:
- two 250W 24V DC motors
- two BTS7960B H bridges
- two 12V 20Ah batteries connected in series
- Raspberry PI pico W
- three AA NiMH batteries
- three wheels:
  - two connected on standalone shaft, each motor drives each shaft/wheel
  - single wheel on the back, able to rotate in 360 degrees radius
- a lot of welded iron/steel :)
